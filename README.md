This .py file contains the report and analysis about the analysis of Canadian turbine engine (energy generation) datasets.
The datasets were provided by stakeholders working alongside the Faculty of Science (University of Calgary).
Final Project Score: A+

Additionally, I have also attached 3 individual projects regarding the analyses of various datasets using R alongside 2 files containing projects in which I have created relational databases and analyzed them using SQL/MySQL (DBMS).

Lastly, I have attached a game of Pong I have developed using PyCharm.
