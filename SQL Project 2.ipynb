    "This is an individual homework assignment. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.\n",
    "- Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.\n",
    "- You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course.\n",
    "- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these rules seem ambiguous, please check with with your instructor for help interpreting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest completing this assignment using the provided notebook. Each question should be answered using a SQL query (or combination or SQL queries) unless the text indicates that you may (or should) do something else. You may submit your queries embedded in Python, using SQLAlchemy or the MySQL Connector, or as plain text in Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When you submit your work\n",

    "Your submission will be graded manually. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, please follow these instructions to prepare your notebook for submission to the D2L Dropbox for Assignment 3:\n",

    "- Please provide your solutions where asked; please do not alter any other parts of this notebook.\n",
    "- If you need to add cells to test your code please move them to the end of the notebook before submission- or you may included your commented out answers and tests in the cells provided"

    "We will be using two datasets from Open Data Calgary. The Census by Community 2019 dataset shows results of the 2019 Civic Census. This is a separate process from that used by Statistics Canada to produce the national census, some of which results we explored in the previous assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This census data counts dwelling units in the city and categorized the population within each unit, aggregating results by community. The original dataset has been partially cleaned for you, removing some columns which are not relevant to the assignment. However, given that there are still 75 columns remaining, you may want to use SQLAlchemy or another bulk load tool to handle the creation of the database table for this dataset, before altering the table as needed to change data types or creating indexes.\n",

    "In the section below, you have the option to discuss any data cleaning and wrangling steps performed during this process. This is not a requirement and will not be assessed directly for grading; however, this may help to clarify to your reader exactly what was done, to make your work below more understandable."

Community allocation of provincial government spending indicates the level and development of social services that are provided to various residential areas within YYC (if certain communities have a need for more clinics or more community centres - for example - these can be budgeted for and appropriately resolved).\n",

    "From my interpretations of what has been instructed to me thus far and my experiences with both JSON and SQL, SQL is known for being a higher performance programming language that can allow for easy storage, collection, and parsing of data. NoSQL/MySQL (in Python) have allowed us to quickly read in tables from .CSV files (and other file format types) and from there we are able to easily apply 1 - 2 line queries to retrieve the data we would like. In JSON files the introductory steps of firstly setting up the correct formatting for the data structure in it of itself is quite time consuming and overall inefficient. Coupling this with having to read the data multi-dimensionally (or through multi-level indexing) allows us to parse the data in a less efficient manner. When looking at Question 5 from Part B querying with multiple conditions in 1 - 2 lines allows us to retrieve the data in an intuitive and simple manner; when looking at summation for this question it is built into the query itself as well. When parsing data with multiple conditions in a .JSON file structure we would have to set up the .JSON file code with nested for-loop and if-elif-else statements to help reach even one part of our answer. For example, Question 5 asks us to create a list of 10 communities with the highest residency counts; in SQL this is a matter of simply selecting the columns we would like to include, include a summation expression, and then include our join tables as well as where clauses. Whereas for .JSON, we would have to first start by indexing based upon the community names as a key then individually retrieve through more looping and parsing the information related to specific community services, and then collect their individual counts (which would be the value in the key:value pair), from there we would have to add the values manually as summation in this case would not create a separate key:value pair and finally we would have to ensure from the very beginning that both .CSV files were incorporated into the .JSON file structure together to replicate a branching or multi-dimensional-esque structure that will help with parsing with the usage of key:value pairs. From this comparison and example it is evident that SQL is much easier to retrieve information from and .JSON is much more difficult respectively."

    "The main concept from this assignment that I particularly found challenging were two: understanding the joining of two tables and advanced filtering with SQL queries. With regards to the first challenge I used my critical-thinking skills to help decipher what table rows needed to remain after the join and by identifying patterns in the files I was able to determine what each row within the tables meant (explained in some detail earlier in this assignment). The usage of pattern identification had helped me to get a better understanding of the dataset overall and made my future querying processes much more effective as well as efficient. With regards to the completion of filtering SQL my first approach was to attempt each query through a step-by-step approach, where I would implement one component of what I wanted SQL to derive from the data and increment my code to include specific information through the addition of more filters. By incrementing my queries in such a way I was able to add the various pieces of the SQL filter sequentially and at the same time greatly reduced the time needed to complete my queries. My main approach within this second case was to firstly visualize what information I wanted to have SQL dissect for me; I would write out in simple language on a piece of paper what I wanted the SQL query to return to me (whilst also using the sequential methodology aforementioned). From there I would work to specify what information was necessary and non-necessary to help reduce the amount of lines (decreasing inefficiencies with my code in the process) to help optimize my queries. I would cross reference my answers with the Excel filtering tool to help ensure that I had received the values I was directly looking for. For the most part with regards to this assignment an adjustment in thinking and methodologies was required as I had already used SQL in past university coursework, it was merely how to adapt my previous experiences with the programming languages into these new tasks that I had aimed to resolve."
